## Getting Started

#### Tracking your course progress in a PR :octocat:

1. **Switch to the `develop` Branch:**  
   * In your `trestle-workspace` repository, navigate to the "Branches" tab or use the dropdown menu.  
   * Switch from the `main` branch to the `develop` branch.  
   * All your course changes will be made on this `develop` branch.

2. **Make Your First Change:**  
   * Edit the `README.md` file in your `develop` branch to include your name.  
   * Commit your changes directly to the `develop` branch by clicking "Commit Changes."

3. **Create Your Pull Request (PR):**  
   * Go to the "Pull Requests" tab in your repository.  
   * Click the "New Pull Request" button.  
   * Ensure the comparison is set to: `base: main` **\<--** `compare: develop`.  
   * You should see your `README.md` change listed in the file differences.  
   * Provide a descriptive title for your PR (e.g., `feat: My First Course Submission - [Your Name]`).  
   * Click "Create pull request."

   * Bookmark your PR page. :bookmark:
   * Use the "Comments" section within your PR to ask questions or make notes about your progress. This is a great way to engage with the material and receive support. ðŸ’¬
  
## Deep Dive 

#### Pull Request Body

The "New Pull Request" will take the changes you made to the `README.md` and place those in a history log. Then, that log will be proposed to be merged to the `main` branch of the repository.

Notice the _Write_ and _Preview_ tabs. Markdown format is present in the _Write_ tab. Check your mardown plain text using _Preview_.

## Usage

### Using the trestle-workspace

> #### Manually updating an OSCAL Component Definition

> You can manually update an OSCAL Component Definition in the `component-definitions` folder of the trestle-workspace.
<img alt="compdef_folder.img" height="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8085baa4-e3a9-4d2b-bd4a-5e81dc545017" width="400"/>

> #### Leveraging GitHub Actions to author Component Definitions :octocat:

> The GitHub Actions available will allow you to create OSCAL Component Definitions using the `workflow_dispatch` functionality.

##### :world_map: Steps:

1. Navigate to the Actions tab in your trestle-workspace.
2. Click the action in the top left corner that is named [Create a Component Definition](https://github.com/hbraswelrh/trestle-workspace/actions/workflows/create-cd.yml).
3. Click "Run workflow." There should be a box populated that requests the following inputs:
   - Name of profile in trestle workspace to be imported into the component definition. 
   - Name of component definition to create.
   - Name of the component in the generated component definition.
   - Type of component (e.g., service, policy, physical, validation, etc. ).
   - Description of the component in the generate component definition.
   - Filter the component definition control by a separate profile.
